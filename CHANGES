0.03 - fixed random number generation
==========
- Wrote Die::roll the right way so there is no longer a limit to the number
  of sides (thanks to Thomas R. Sibley).  I am dumb.  :)

0.02 - added D&D dice specification, Dice::roll, documentation
==========
- Increased die side limit from 100 to 10000 and documented the limit
- Added documentation for Games::Die::Dice
- Games::Die::Dice now supports "D&D style" die descriptors in its constructor
  (such as "2d8" or "6d20")
- Games::Die::Dice::roll now returns the sum of the roll in scalar context,
  as one would expect!

0.01 - initial release
