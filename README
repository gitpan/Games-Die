Games::Die
===========

Version: 0.03



Overview:

This module simulates rolling a die.  Also included is Games::Die::Dice which
provides a union of an arbitrary number of dice wihch may be rolled together,
as a group.



License:

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself.



Example:

use Games::Die;
$die = new Games::Die(6);               # a single 6-sided die
$value = $die->roll;

use Games::Die::Dice;
$dice = new Games::Die::Dice(8, 8);     # a pair of 8-sided dice
@values = $dice->roll;                  # get rolls from each die

$dice2 = new Games::Die::Dice("2d8");   # same as above, but using
                                        #   "d" representation
$sum = $dice2->roll;                    # get sum of both rolls

$dice3 = new Games::Die::Dice(5,17,42); # !???



Todo:

- error checking (numeric validation on constructor params, mainly)
- a way to get at the individual dice in a G::D::D set (perhaps a
  contents() or elements() method that returns them all in a list?)
